My research is in applied algebraic topology. Broadly I am interested in the intersections of algebraic topology, machine learning, category theory, and physical applications. My <a href="files/thesis.pdf">PhD thesis</a> is on the topology of Vietoris&ndash;Rips simplicial complex viewed as subspaces of the Wasserstein space of probability measures (so-called "Vietoris&ndash;Rips metric thickenings").
</p>
<p>
I am also part of the NSF-funded <a href="https://delta-topology.org/">Delta project</a>, which uses topology and machine learning to study chemical energy landscapes. I have also worked on problems involving the topological structure of optical flow data and on using persistent homology to understand fractals.

Encoding the complex features of an energy landscape is a challenging task, and
often chemists pursue the most salient features (minima and barriers) along a
highly reduced space, i.e. 2- or 3-dimensions. Even though disconnectivity
graphs or merge trees summarize the connectivity of the local minima of an
energy landscape via the lowest-barrier pathways, there is more information to
be gained by also considering the topology of each connected component at
different energy thresholds (or sublevelsets). We propose sublevelset persistent
homology as an appropriate tool for this purpose. Our computations on the
configuration phase space of n-alkanes from butane to octane allow us to
conjecture, and then prove, a complete characterization of the sublevelset
persistent homology of the alkane C<sub>m</sub>H<sub>2m+2</sub> potential energy
landscapes, for all m, and in all homological dimensions. We further compare
both the analytical configurational potential energy landscapes and sampled data
from molecular dynamics simulation, using the united and all-atom descriptions
of the intramolecular interactions. In turn, this supports the application of
distance metrics to quantify sampling fidelity and lays the foundation for
future work regarding new metrics that quantify differences between the
topological features of high-dimensional energy landscapes.

Many simplicial complexes arising in practice have an associated metric space structure on the vertex set but not on the complex, e.g. the Vietoris–Rips complex in applied topology. We formalize a remedy by introducing a category of simplicial metric thickenings whose objects have a natural realization as metric spaces. The properties of this category allow us to prove that, for a large class of thickenings including Vietoris&ndash;Rips and Čech thickenings, the product of metric thickenings is homotopy equivalent to the metric thickenings of product spaces, and similarly for wedge sums. In addition, we study a Dowker-type theorem for simplicial thickenings.

In <i>A naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation</i>, Butler et al. create a database of ground-truth optical flow from the computer-generated video short <i>Sintel</i>.
We study the high-contrast \(3\times 3\) patches from this video, and provide evidence that this dataset is well-modeled by a <i>torus</i> (a nonlinear \(2\)-dimensional manifold).
Our main tools are persistent homology and zigzag persistence, which are popular techniques from the field of computational topology.
We show that the optical flow torus model is naturally equipped with the structure of a fiber bundle, which is furthermore related to the statistics of range images.</div>

"A fractal dimension for measures via persistent homology" </br>
With Henry Adams, Manuchehr Aminian, Elin Farnell, Michael Kirby, Rachel Neville, Chris Peterson, and Clayton Shonkwiler. </br>
Accepted to appear in Abel Symposia (2019).</br>
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01079">arXiv:1808.01079</a>, <a onclick ="javascript:ShowHide('abPHDimension')" href="javascript:;" >Abstract</a>]</p>

We use persistent homology in order to define a family of fractal dimensions, denoted \(\dim_{\text{PH}}^i(\mu)\) for each homological dimension \(i\ge 0\), assigned to a probability measure \(\mu\) on a metric space.
The case of \(0\)-dimensional homology (\(i=0\)) relates to work by Michael J Steele (1988) studying the total length of a minimal spanning tree on a random sampling of points.
Indeed, if \(\mu\) is supported on a compact subset of Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^m\) for \(m\ge2\), then Steele's work implies that \(\dim_{\text{PH}}^0(\mu)=m\) if the absolutely continuous part of \(\mu\) has positive mass, and otherwise \(\dim_{\text{PH}}^0(\mu) \lt m\). Experiments suggest that similar results may be true for higher-dimensional homology \(0 \lt i \lt m\), though this is an open question.
Our fractal dimension is defined by considering a limit, as the number of points \(n\) goes to infinity, of the total sum of the \(i\)-dimensional persistent homology interval lengths for \(n\) random points selected from \(\mu\) in an i.i.d. fashion.
To some measures \(\mu,\) we are able to assign a finer invariant, a curve measuring the limiting distribution of persistent homology interval lengths as the number of points goes to infinity.
We prove this limiting curve exists in the case of \(0\)-dimensional homology when \(\mu\) is the uniform distribution over the unit interval, and conjecture that it exists when \(\mu\) is the rescaled probability measure for a compact set in Euclidean space with positive Lebesgue measure.

"Metric Thickenings of Euclidean Submanifolds" </br>
With Henry Adams. </br>
Topology and its Applications 254 (2019), 69-84. </br>
[<a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1YKoTbyCKVqOm">Publisher link</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02492">arXiv:1709.02492</a>, <a onclick ="javascript:ShowHide('abEuclidean')" href="javascript:;" >Abstract</a>, <a href="files/masters.pdf">Master's Thesis</a>]</p>
<div id="abEuclidean" style="display:none;"><p>Given a sample \(X\) from an unknown manifold \(M\) embedded in Euclidean space, it is possible to recover the homology groups of \(M\) by building a Vietoris-Rips or &#268;ech simplicial complex on top of the vertex set \(X\).
However, these simplicial complexes need not inherit the metric structure of the manifold, in particular when \(X\) is infinite.
Indeed, a simplicial complex is not even metrizable if it is not locally finite.
We instead consider metric thickenings of \(X\), called the <i>Vietoris-Rips</i> and <i>&#268;ech thickenings</i>, which are equipped with the 1-Wasserstein metric in place of the simplicial complex topology.
We show that for Euclidean subsets \(M\) with positive reach, the thickenings satisfy metric analogues of Hausmann's theorem and the nerve lemma (the metric Vietoris-Rips and &#268;ech thickenings of \(M\) are homotopy equivalent to \(M\) for scale parameters less than the reach).
In contrast to Hausmann's original result, our homotopy equivalence is a deformation retraction, is realized by canonical maps in both directions, and furthermore can be proven to be a homotopy equivalence via simple linear homotopies from the map compositions to the corresponding identity maps.</div>
