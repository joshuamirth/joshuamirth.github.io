# Geodesic Homotopies in Metric Thickenings

# Motivation: Simplicial Complex Topology

Let `\(K\)` be an abstract simplicial complex and `\(|K|\)` its geometric realization.
The simplicial complex topology restricts to the discrete topology on the
vertex set `\(K^0\)`. 

* The vertex set of a Vietoris–Rips complex is a metric space which has a
metric topology.
* If `\(X\)` is a finite metric space, then it carries the discrete topology
and so the geometric realization `\(|\mathrm{VR}(X;r)|\)` agrees with the
natural topology on the vertices.
* If `\(X\)` is not finite, then its metric topology may not be discrete!

**Example:** If `\(X = \mathbb{S}^1\)`, then `\(|\mathrm{VR}(X;r)|^0 = \mathrm{VR}(X;0)\)` is an
uncountable set of discrete points.

One consequence is that the natural inclusion map `\(x \mapsto [x]\)` sending a
point `\(x \in X\)` to a vertex in `\(\mathrm{VR}(X;r)\)` is not continuous
when `\(X\)` is not discrete.

---

# Simplicial Metric Thickenings 

Idea: Reinterpret simplices as _discrete probability measures_ on `\(X\)`.

* In the geometric realization of any simplicial complex, a point in a simplex
  is specified by barycentric coordinates: if `\(\sigma = [x_0 , \ldots ,
  x_k]\)`, then any `\(x \in \sigma\)` is given by a formal sum
`$$
x = \sum_{i=0}^{k} \lambda_{i} x_{i}
$$`
where `\(\sum \lambda_{i} = 1 \)` and `\(\lambda_i > 0\)` for all `\(i\)`.

* Points can therefore be interpreted as probability measures:
`$$
\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{k} \lambda_{i} x_{i} \iff \sum_{i=0}^{k} \lambda_{i} \delta[x_{i}]
$$`
where `\(\delta[x_{i}] = \delta_{x_i}\)` is the Dirac measure at `\(x_{i} \in X\)`.

---

# Transport Plans

Let `\(\mu\)` and `\(\nu\)` be probability measures on `\(X\)`. A _transport
plan_ is a measure `\(\pi\)` on `\(X \times X\)` with marginals `\(\mu\)` and
`\(\nu\)`: for any measurable `\(A \subseteq X\)`,
`$$
\pi(A \times X) = \mu(A) \quad \text{ and } \quad \pi(X \times A) = \nu(A) .
$$`

Intuition: `\(f : X \to X\)` a function such that `\(f_\#\mu = \nu\)`. Gives a transport
plan with `\(\pi = (\mathrm{id}, f)_\#\mu\)`. Not all transport plans come from functions
(i.e. a one-to-many operation may be used). There is always at least one
transport plan given by the product measure `\(\pi = \mu \otimes \nu\)`.

The _cost_ of a transport plan is the amount of mass move times the distance by
which it is transported:
`$$
\mathrm{cost}(\pi) = \left( \int d(x,y)^2 \, \mathrm{d}\pi \right)^{1/2} .
$$`
(Other `\(p\)`-norms may also be used.)

# Wasserstein Space

.figuresplit[<img src="wasserstein_eg.png" width=90% height=90% />]

.textsplit[The space of all probability measures on `\(X\)`,`\(\mathcal{P}(X)\)`,
can be given a topology by defining the Wasserstein distance:

`$$
\displaystyle W_2(\mu,\nu) = \inf_{\pi} \left( \int_{X \times X} d(x,y)^2 \,
\mathrm{d}\pi \right)^{1/2}
$$`
where the infimum is taken over all transport plans.]

--

.textsplit[
.defn[**Definition:**] The **Vietoris–Rips metric thickening**,
`\(\mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)`, consists of all measures on `\(X\)` corresponding to
points in simplices in `\(\mathrm{VR}(X;r)\)`.

* Observe that `\(W_2(\delta[x_0],\delta[x_1]) = d(x_0,x_1)\)`,
  so the inclusion `\(\delta \colon X \to \mathcal{VR}(X;r) \)` is continuous.

# Geodesics in Wasserstein Space

A space `\(X\)` is **geodesic** if there is a path (a map `\(\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X\)`) connecting `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` with `\( \mathrm{length}(\gamma) = d(x,y) \)` for all `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` in `\(X\)`.
* **Examples:** Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds, (connected) metric graphs. 
* **Non-example:** discrete metric spaces.

.fiftyfiftyleft[When `\(X\)` is geodesic, the Wasserstein space
`\(\mathcal{P}(X)\)` is also geodesic. Geodesics are given by pushing the
optimal `\(\pi\)` forward along geodesic curves in `\(X\)`:

**Note:** `\(\mathcal{P}(X)\)` also has a _linear_ structure. Any convex
combination `\((1-t)\mu + t\nu\)` for `\(t \in [0,1]\)` is an element of `\(\mathcal{P}(X)\)`.
However, the linear path `\(\gamma(t) = (1-t)\mu + t\nu\)` is not geodesic. In
fact, it is infinitely long in the 2-Wassertein distance!

# Hausmann-Type Theorems and Geodesics

# Hausmann-Style Theorems via Geodesics

.defn[**Theorem:**] [Hausmann] For a Riemannian manifold `\(M\)`, and sufficiently small `\(r \gt 0\)`, there is a homotopy equivalence between the Vietoris–Rips simplicial complex and the manifold, `\(\mathrm{VR}(M;r) \simeq M\)`.

* The proof is difficult because there is no natural continuous map `\(M \to \mathrm{VR}(M;r)\)`.

.defn[**Theorem:**] [Adamaszek, Adams, Frick] For a Riemannian manifold `\(M\)` and sufficiently small `\(r\)` there is a homotopy equivalence `\(\mathcal{VR}(M;r) \simeq M\)`.

* With the metric thickening there is a natural map `\(M \to \mathcal{VR}(M;r)\)` via `\(x \mapsto
\delta[x]\)`. We can also map from `\(\mathcal{VR}(M;r) \to M\)` via the "Karcher
mean"/Riemannian center of mass:

--

The center of mass of `\(\mu\)`, a measure on `\(X\)`, is any minimizer of
`$$
P_{\mu}(x) = \int_{X} d(x,y)^2 \, \mathrm{d}\mu(y) .
$$`
Existence of a minimum is guaranteed if `\(X\)` is _proper_. Uniqueness does
not hold in general.

---

## Proof Outline:

Let `\(\delta \colon X \to \mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)` be the Dirac delta map and let
`\(K \colon \mathcal{VR}(X;r) \to X\)` be the center of mass map (not
necessarily well-defined). Observe that `\(K \circ \delta\)` is the identity.
Thus `\(\mathcal{VR}(X;r) \simeq X\)` if `\(\delta \circ K \simeq
\mathrm{id}\)`.

[Adamaszek, Adams, Frick] give a homotopy via curves of the form `\((1-t)\delta[K(\mu)] +
t\mu\)`.

We can also use geodesic curves. Let `\(\gamma_\mu(t)\)` be the geodesic in
Wasserstein space connecting `\(\mu\)` to `\(\delta[K(\mu)]\)`.

To show that `\(X\)` and `\(\mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)` are homotopy equivalent we
need to show that
1. Any `\(\mu \in \mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)` has a unique center of mass (so `\(K\)`
is well-defined), and
2. The geodesics `\(\gamma_\mu(t)\)` remain in `\(\mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)`, i.e.
the diameter of `\(\gamma_\mu(t)\)` does not increase.

--

The key to both conditions is understanding the _curvature_ of `\(X\)`.

---

## Curvature Considerations

A triangle in a geodesic space, `\(X\)`, is a set of three points `\(p, q\)`, and `\(r\)`, and a choice of geodesics connecting each of them.
A _comparison triangle_ in `\(\mathbb{R}^d\)` is a triangle with vertices `\(\vec{p}, \vec{q}\)`, and `\(r\)` and side lengths equal to the lengths of the geodesics in `\(X\)`.

.center[<img src="comparison_triangles.png" width=40% height=40%>]

The space `\(X\)` is non-positively curved (NPC) in a neighborhood of `\(p,q,\)` and `\(r\)` if the distance from `\(q\)` to every point on the edge between `\(p\)` and `\(r\)` is less than in the Euclidean triangle, and non-negatively curved if greater (and the same holds for all triangles in the neighborhood).

Curvature is a local condition, but if it holds for all triangles in `\(X\)`, we say `\(X\)` is globally non-positively or non-negatively curved.

---

## Curvature and Means:

.fiftyfiftyleft[
* If `\(X\)` is global NPC then any measure `\(\mu\)` on `\(N\)` has a unique mean which varies continuously _and_ the diameter of `\(\gamma_\mu(t)\)` is decreasing.
* If there is an `\(r > 0\)` such that all subsets of `\(X\)` with diameter less than `\(r\)` are both NPC and geodesically convex, then the same holds.
* If `\(X\)` is non-negatively curved, then by theorems of [Afsari] and [Karcher] there is a small enough `\(r\)` for these conditions to hold.
]

.fiftyfiftyright[.center[<img src="homotopy2.gif" width=50% height=50% />]
]

.left[
Consequently, we get:

.defn[**Theorem:**] If `\(X\)` is a geodesic space and `\(r\)` is sufficiently small depending on the curvature of `\(X\)`, then `\(\mathrm{VR}(X;r) \simeq X\)`.
]

---

## Novel Corollaries:

This theorem is a slight refinement of the theorem of [Adamaszek, Adams, Frick] but uses the natural geodesic structure, giving some natural corollaries.

Under the assumptions required in the theorem:

.defn[**Corollary 1:**] The `\(k\)`-skeleton of `\(\mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)` is homotopy equivalent to `\(X\)` for sufficiently small `\(r\)`.

.defn[**Corollary 2:**] The infinite Vietoris–Rips thickening, `\(\mathcal{VR}^\infty(X;r)\)`, consisting of _all_ measures with support bounded in diameter by `\(r\)` is homotopy equivalent to `\(X\)` for sufficiently small `\(r\)`.

Both follow because the cardinality of the support of a geodesic `\(\gamma_\mu(t)\)` can only decrease.


---

# Some Open Questions:

* The homotopy type of `\(\mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)` is generally unknown beyond the bound on `\(r\)` given here. The case `\(X = S^1\)` is of particular interest and is still unknown beyond `\(r = \frac{1}{3}\)`.
* More generally, in all known examples `\(\mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)` and `\(\mathrm{VR}(X;r)\)` (with the `\(\lt\)` convention) are homotopy equivalent. Does this always hold?
* Similarly, `\(\mathcal{VR}^\infty(X;r)\)` and `\(\mathcal{VR}(X;r)\)` are homotopy equivalent in all known examples, but this is not proven in general.
