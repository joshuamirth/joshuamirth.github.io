I am a Senior Data Science Analyst in the department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering at the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayo.edu) in Rochester, Minnesota. Previously I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Computational Math, Science, and Engineering department at Michigan State University, and I received my PhD in mathematics from Colorado State University.

Some of my professional interests include
* Topological data analysis,
* Machine learning,
* Geometry in data science.

You can find more about my research at [my research page](research.md).

I write about topics related to mathematics, statistics, and data science. Occasionally that ends up on the [blog page](blog.md).
