After years of using hacked-together hand-written html and javascript, I have finally updated this website to use Jekyll and GitHub pages. Given the simplicity of the old site (mandated essentially by its rudimentary construction) the conversion was not terribly difficult, especially once I figured out how to use MathJax in Jekyll (helpful post [1](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2018/08/05/mathjax-in-jekyll/) and [2](http://benlansdell.github.io/computing/mathjax/)).  Keeping things up-to-date will now be much easier for me, but as inevitably happens with a website upgrade, various links get broken and pages removed. Most notably I have not redone my "talks" and "teaching" pages. In the event you are here looking for lecture notes or slides from a talk I once gave, currently the best way to get those is to ask in an email.
